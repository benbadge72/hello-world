# About Me

I am a middle aged gentleman living in rural West Virginia. Live with my
wife and several dogs we call our kids. The dogs are mutts and we're
happy with that. We do at times get cats, presently, we have no cats. 

Programming wise, I am still very much a hobby based programmer. I know
a little about quite a few programing languages yet do not in any way
consider myself fully competent in any one of them, let alone two of
them. I piddle and dabble whilst learning. 

Why use Git hub if not a developer? Well, I may perhaps "get there" and
it's always nice to be abreast of current goings on. It also gives me
space to learn and store lessons, ideas, thoughts. In that sense I'm
using my git hub space as a learning platform & journal. Excuse any
untidiness.
