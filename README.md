Welcome to a humble Git space.

# About Me

Middle aged gentleman living in rural West Virginia, USA. A humbled autodidactic polymath describes me. Not so much into computer programming or developing. It is a slight hobby at best, as is using GNU Linux over the last decade or so. At present I'm employeed as a stringer custodian for our local county school board. Wife and I still adopt furry critters as children.

Figure this space will be for writing projects, possibly a journal, artistic or epressive uses. Not seeking to use it as a means of self promotion, branding, attaining employment. Git is something "new & neat" and thought a CVS (Concurrent Versioning System) might be interesting to use for basic record keeping.
